# raspi-hc-sr04

RaspberryPi - Native Node.js extention to interact with an Ultrasonic Sensor.

## Fork

Forked from `raspi-sonar` project to resolve some issues around wiringpi and other modernizing (gulp + babel).  Also I had trouble getting the one wire scheme working, so I adapted the code to use two pins.

## Installation

```
apt-get install wiringpi
npm install raspi-sonar
```

## Example

Note that GPIO pins are rated at 3.3v. An ultrasonic sensor like the HC-SR04 outputs 5v on the echo pin which could harm your Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. Take care to use a voltage divider circuit to lower the voltage from the ECHO pin to the GPIO pin.

### Code

```javascript
import Sonar from 'raspi-hc-sr04';
let sonar = new Sonar({ triggerPin: 2, echoPin: 3 });

sonar.read((duration) => {
  let distance = 343000.0 * duration / 1000000 * .5;
  console.log(`duration: ${ duration } distance: ${ distance }cm`);
});
```

## API

raspi-sonar npm package exposes a single class called Sonar. The Sonar class has a single public method that takes the wiringPi pin number as an argument. If you installed [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com) (which will automatically be installed when you install the raspi-sonar package), you can check the which pin number to use by typing the command `gpio readall`. The output for a Raspberry Pi B+ would look like the below diagram. Note the 'wPi' columns.
